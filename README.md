Hey! How's it going? I'm a supply chain professional that works for C&S Wholesale Grocers. I'm passionate about CPG, cigars, and all things tech.

Supply Chain
I'm a senior supply chain manager within C&S' inbound quality department where I work with household name vendors. In the past, I've involved myself with CPG packaging and efforts to reduce food waste in the supply chain. I've also worked towards automating and standardizing common processes to leverage our talent for other exciting projects! In 2018, I participated in a consumer research project for Coca-Cola and Walmart as a study administrator.

Cigars
I occasionally smoke cigars. I post reviews in series on Nubphile at nubphile.com.

Photography
I'm an avid photographer, regularly shooting portraits, events, and products. My headshot website can be found here.
